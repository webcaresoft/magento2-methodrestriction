### Overview
Sometimes store owners have a requirement to restrict some of the shipping or payment methods to a particular customer group. Unfortunately, there is no such functionality available by default which allows the admin to set such rules for payment and shipping. 

To fulfill this requirement we have developed an extension which allows the admin to restrict payment and shipping methods from the admin without changing any code. Using restrict payment and shipping store owner can easily set the particular payment or shipping method for particular customer group only, so selected Groups customer cannot place an order from the selected Payment and Shipping method.

### Features:
* Admin can easily restrict shipping and payment method from the admin panel
* Simple Configuration for select multiple customer groups and multiple payment and shipping method
* Restrict Shipping methods based on customer group.
* Restrict Payment methods based on customer group.
* All Code Include Magento Standard Development Practice.
